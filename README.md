## STEP-hw1
I started doing the homework in C, however, when I started doing the #3 goal of the homework I became stuck. 
After finding some hints online, I decided to redo the homework in Python.  
anagram_scores.py can find anagrams that use both all and only a subset of characters in a given string, and find the highest scoring anagram.  
find_anagram.c can only find single word anagrams that use all the characters in a given string.
